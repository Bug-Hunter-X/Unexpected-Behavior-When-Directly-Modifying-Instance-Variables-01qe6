# Unexpected Behavior When Directly Modifying Instance Variables in Ruby

This example demonstrates a potential issue when directly modifying instance variables using `instance_variable_set` in Ruby.  While this method provides access to internal object state, it can bypass encapsulation and lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.

The `bug.rb` file shows how modifying an instance variable directly using `instance_variable_set` changes the object's state.  This can be problematic for debugging and code maintainability as it breaks encapsulation, makes code harder to reason about, and can lead to inconsistencies if other parts of the code rely on the object's methods to access and modify the instance variable. 

The `bugSolution.rb` offers a more robust solution by using accessor methods, maintaining better encapsulation and readability.
